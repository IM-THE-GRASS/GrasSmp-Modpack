This mod adds a hand full of peripherals that allow futher access to Creates features.\n\n## Content\n> 👉 _**Create** now actually has native support for **CC: Tweaked** too! But why stop there?_\n\n- **Two essential blocks of this mod are the `Source Block` and `Target Block`.**\nThey simulate a source or target, making it possible to comunicate within every other source/target that **Create** provides.\n\n- Another block that can come in very handy is the `RedRouter Block`.\nIt can send or receive redstone signals without having to worry about wireless channels or by using multible Computers, using the Redstone API.\n\n- This mod also adds some smaller, fun things like the `Scroller Pane` or `Animatronic`. The Scroller Pane lets you select a number and send it to a Computer using **Creates** interface, while the Animatronic is a puppet you can [control and animate as you like!](https://youtu.be/MI_tHMHrAY0)\n\n### Psst, hey!

Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End.

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6523064,"followers":5420,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":1880003,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa","sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\immersive_paintings-0.6.7+1.20.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"b96b55628408387252074a440b4d58831ef1281914cdb73e56bfeb1a9fdf94d04d5f471945c2af675eff0835226e1633c2ce444e451837bd36e2bfcb34dcb81e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"6txNkua3","slug":"immersive-paintings","project_type":"mod","team":"iYK20x5F","title":"Immersive Paintings","description":"Drag and drop, pixelate and hang up beautiful art.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

ID \"create_bic_bit\"?**\n\nThis mod used to be called \"Create: Bicycles and Bitterballen\" but that's no longer the case because we wanted to release it before we were done with the bicycle part of the addon.\n\n**Are bicycles still planned?**\n\nYES! ( and currently being worked on :3 )\n\n \n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n[Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)\n\n

Originally it was a part of [Pufferfish's Skills](https://modrinth.com/mod/skills) mod, but was split and now can be used independently.\n\n## Attributes\n\nSome attributes work different from vanilla ones. Instead of providing a value they modify dynamic values using addition or multiplication. For example damage dealt by attacking using various weapons. They work like normal attributes, but their base value is internally set to the dynamic value. Changing base value of these attributes is not possible, because it is permanently set to [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). These attributes are marked as dynamic in their description below.\n\n- Stamina\n- Melee Damage\n- Ranged damage\n- Fortune\n- Healing\n- Jump\n- Resistance\n- Mining Speed\n- Sprinting Speed\n- Knockback\n\n### Stamina\n\nAttribute `puffish_attributes:player.stamina` allows to change hard coded stamina value, which is 4 by default. Stamina determines how much exhaustion player must collect to decrease food/saturation points.\n\n### Melee Damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.melee_damage` modifies damage dealt using melee weapons.\n\n### Ranged damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.ranged_damage` modifies damage dealt using ranged weapons.\n\n### Fortune\n\nDynamic attribute  `puffish_attributes:player.fortune` modifies fortune when mining a block, also applies without having fortune enchant on the item.\n\n### Healing\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.healing` modifies how much health is restored by natural regeneration.\n\n### Jump\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.jump` modifies how high player can jump.\n\n### Resistance\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.resistance` modifies resistance of the player\n\n### Mining Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.mining_speed` modifies mining speed of the player.\n\n### Sprinting Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.sprinting_speed` modifies sprinting speed of the player.\n\n### Knockback\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.knockback` modifies knockback power of the player.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. It may conflict with other mods that add similar attributes. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n**It is incompatibility with every version below 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, because that versions includes everything that Pufferfish's Attributes adds. However, version 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, when released, will no longer contain Pufferfish's Attributes, therefore these mods will be compatible.**\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates are: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2, 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.","published":"2024-03-28T19:41:07.521172Z","updated":"2024-06-02T17:23:01.276929Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":16147,"followers":18,"categories":["game-mechanics","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["management"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["vjyrgZ4t","aEXrd6Gk","akYwrf2x","OwpspM8j","q1YNYX46","HtTHEvn5","2jVaBWQQ","KiBBrgIr","aowYX1Ng","w8DsSlyJ","kLlwnjhn","OMRHNS0p","eOzlYeYS","jZ6clufT","2mtm3wlX","7ZCWortj","1RMeTDan","RYphekww","TouzHJRA","89goX9JR","Zs11lNLI","mRqyVmZg","Hv1gf4f7","FWcjGg1K","tgtUFpm3","LfFhx9Iy","fQadECPH","uIfUdSKo","i8zbWbtl","AeGH5WvW","BeCYfSDL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/f25e0000aca9f043997af84f44d33099f7c6b8ef.png"},"version":{"id":"LfFhx9Iy","project_id":"FCFcFw09","author_id":"3fJOgX88","featured":false,"name":"Pufferfish's Attributes 0.3.0","version_number":"0.3.0","changelog":"- Improved compatibility.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-02T17:22:03.996997Z","downloads":3871,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"60fc1dd3c1acba01d7576af1411be6c7094ad85380d78ed0fd5f2d86fdec69c4b8d85fe90593c8a1e9cfd6038cf8131a150ec6b94e77faac27722060f2b301eb","sha1":"2f661ffc04fb0d4944a6c8245a831115ef7fe831"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/versions/LfFhx9Iy/puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar","filename":"puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":22635,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L04V2Tpb","user":{"id":"3fJOgX88","username":"Pufferfish","name":"pufferfish","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82769502?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-28T22:28:22.642802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar"},"mods\\gravestones-v1.15.jar":{"sha512":"d15c6db9d9154464f335f01ae7f8ce8d2473251ed5a6c094a2f6e59ba778de6dfdefd7ee6a08d5908b826e37028de8edc3745a7af19ee00b59971f33bdfee2c5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ssUbhMkL","slug":"gravestones","project_type":"mod","team":"ggl32fu7","title":"Gravestones","description":"A gravestones mod for fabric with tons of config options, an API, and more!

banner](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/images/101ca5b7809ad50252bee78c8dfe456d65881d4e.png)\n\nThis is the fabric port of the mod **Farmer's Delight**, you can see the forge version *__[here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight)__*.\n\n-----\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a collection of rustic tools and workstations, you can improve the foundation of your farm plots, prepare a myriad of hearty meals and snacks, and even gear up a bit better for adventure!\n\nThis mod focuses on giving more purpose to items often forgotten or overlooked by players (such as milk, mushrooms, beetroots etc). Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric version)](https://discord.gg/MskvEhPDQz)\n* [Report Issues](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)\n* [Discord of main mod/author (Forge version)](https://discord.gg/eFsz5SK)\n* [Twitter vectorwing (original forge mod author)](https://twitter.com/vectorwing)","published":"2022-06-18T17:51:27.070187Z","updated":"2023-12-08T13:30:25.991858Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1134425,"followers":1144,"categories":["decoration","food","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["FG4vSwZt","EpdWyovh","cRnlUfGm","yx8C6sef","BYSArmvd","vHfAq5KW","RSpZmgnD","GJJkeGOX","j28o9UzD","buJjlyP3","JMZ3SwVr","4POXSYDm","G8lpe9fB","baQ9tohQ","Zlgy4hSU","TSMy7brE","DzmY31OQ","cyNt2Gp3","lpeIiuMj","YFvijG6F","rlm3hWGx","vzoppMtR","QXYNitXw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"QXYNitXw","project_id":"4EakbH8e","author_id":"8ylDo0gI","featured":true,"name":"1.4.3 - 1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.3","changelog":"## 1.4.3 - 1.20-1.20.1 *[FD-1.2.0]*\n#### Required dependencies :\n* Fabric Loader : **0.14.21+1.20**\n* Fabric API : >= **0.83.0+1.20**\n\n#### Changelog :\n* fix crops break on non watered farmland **[#206](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/206)** (thanks to _[BarchamMal](https://github.com/BarchamMal)_)\n* add cutting recipes for cherry wood and log **[#219](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/219)** (thanks to _[BarchamMal](https://github.com/BarchamMal)_)\n* add possibility to plant pitcher pods on rich soil **[#189](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/189)** (thanks to _[BarchamMal](https://github.com/BarchamMal)_)\n* fix crash when using the bogey selection menu from create: steam n rails **[#205](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/205)** (thanks to _[AwesomeDude091](https://github.com/AwesomeDude091)_)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T13:30:28.735014Z","downloads":407648,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0645dd6af99cee2e00d766a0a221dce93ce8be72f5a968639e29681800972c9cdb7e2aebab0000e9909a7398173497e43ce9ac22eaa7b51ad9e6d411bf81b493","sha1":"758d7931e769dc4a78ff6642976cffbe75a522cb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/versions/QXYNitXw/farmers-delight-fabric-1.4.3.jar","filename":"farmers-delight-fabric-1.4.3.jar","primary":true,"size":2718948,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"hFdJG9fY","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"S5wyPP3c","user":{"id":"8ylDo0gI","username":"Zifiv","name":"KEVIN BEAUCORAL","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/833854?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-18T17:41:39.413791Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"farmers-delight-fabric-1.4.3.jar"},"mods\\ForgeConfigAPIPort-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"257cd85263ab5119ce78cf16f2e7fdaf8b350e526c758d00f0af8393b9fabd581a2a974096fc7c7af45d793660e2e7b84391e11d10522036759ec66220a4b616","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ohNO6lps","slug":"forge-config-api-port","project_type":"mod","team":"Lcr15WUK","title":"Forge Config API Port","description":"NeoForge's & Forge's config systems provided to other modding ecosystems.

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q.

Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":930370,"followers":875,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"Mkla4B3q","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:43.157958Z","downloads":413237,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f3858977becfbc26f67f4a5579881e15e07d69d","sha512":"ca96f56dba50ea4827ec7a15bc590ccb29aba01896550d3cb398bed18acdf469dd351cdc9312e4743f54955b3162e744c58d76c88eb79b1e5e5b4570f5b33c64"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/Mkla4B3q/carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":443033,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.1-2.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"b488d2d96b32777fe65f17dabee99bea894d349980c5b5eb4feb4db616b44e0a21008c0bf485353e93eee2c00d61f9286411926e39b5f992267fd67b5d14edb9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4I1XuqiY","slug":"entity-model-features","project_type":"mod","team":"fXLgMy6f","title":"[EMF] Entity Model Features","description":"EMF is an, OptiFine format, Custom Entity Model replacement mod available for Fabric and Forge.","body":"<div align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/master/fabric/src/main/resources/icon.png\" alt=\"EMF icon\" width=200>\n\n# Entity Model Features\n \n[![Modrinth downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/entity-model-features?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&style=round&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)\n[![CurseForge downloads](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_844662_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features)\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\nEntity Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

Name Tag. Press the button to inscribe the card. The Name Tag will not get consumed.\n\nYou can optionally give the Name Tag a custom name using an Anvil to give your Cards different purposes.\n\n#### Inscribing Tickets\n\nInserting a Empty Ticket into the Card Inscriber causes a new field to show up.\n\n![Ticket in Card Inscriber](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/bd26b3cb7ad5e4ca7906a0be86b5179e6f902c3f.png)\n\nUse the scroll wheel on this field to change the amount of uses this ticket should have.\n\n### Card Reader\n![Card Reader Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6b915cc714611b2583352eb92a40817507bcae0d.png)\n\nThis block emits a redstone signal when it reads a valid card.\n\nOnce placed, use a Wrench on it.\n\n![Card Reader GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/25af49e28a03945d72dd6aa57ab8a4d83b5bd330.png)\n\nOnly the owner can open this menu. Place a Card or Ticket into the first slot and press the plus button to add it to this reader. The amount of cards and tickets registered are shown next to this button. Next to that is a trash button to remove all cards and tickets from the reader.\nBelow is an option to change the length of the redstone pulse emitted. Use the scroll wheel to change the values. \"Ticks\" can be changed to \"Seconds\".\n\nThe owner and the custom name are stored, so cards with the same name made by the same person are considered the same.\n\n### Empty Card\n![Empty Card Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/83fdc59dc5f8ee8475a69eabcbf7c3a45195ddca.png)\n\nUse this in a Card Inscriber.\n\n### Empty Ticket\n![Empty Ticket](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6dd91703cec40ae39cebd07ce4a95a2e36052af7.png)\n![Used Ticket](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/038f3a73079f9cedf33a513c047f4efb353594a4.png)\n\nSingle-use card.

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible. With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a

This is required for Simply Skills to generate files. (Not needed for 1.20+ versions)**\n\n### **Features**\n\nSimply Skills provides a combat oriented skill tree for Fabric, complete with unique passive skills, specialisations, and signature abilities.\n\nDriven by a vision to enrich combat encounters within Minecraft, Simply Skills harnesses the power of the  [Spell Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-engine)  &  [Spell Power Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-power)  framework (created by Daedelus). By adopting this framework, players are empowered with distinctive skill sets that enable them to stand out among their peers and fully immerse themselves in the class fantasy they desire.\n\n#### **- Passive Skills -**\n\nUnlike the typical stat increase nodes on the tree, Passive Skills provide you with unique passive abilities that alter game mechanics in unique and meaningful ways.\n\n#### **- Specialisations -**\n\nSpecialisations can be unlocked by working your way through the base skill tree, until you reach a specialisation path. Once a specialisation path has been chosen, you will unlock an additional seperate skill tree that contains abilities and skills unique to your chosen specialisation. You may only have one specialisation unlocked at a time.\n\n#### **- Signature Abilities -**\n\nSignature Abilities, unlocked by advancing to a specialisation path, provide you with unique active abilities that can help to turn the tide of battle. These abilities can often be further enhanced and customised via passive nodes in the relevant specialisation skill tree. Due to their power, these abilities have an internal cooldown. (default keybind 'V')\n\n#### **- Respecialisation -**\n\nYour base skill tree can be reset by using a Malevolent Manuscript. This will refund all points spent in the tree.  \nIf you have a specialisation unlocked at the time of use, this will also erase all points spent within the specialisation tree. The points lost will be gone forever, so choose carefully.\n\n### **Roadmap**\nSubject to change\n\nQ4 2023: Ascendancy Tree\n- Additional late-game player progression\n\nQ1 2024: Additional Specialisations\n- Necromancer & Shaman\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWant to play with Simply Skills on a server with friends?

Torch</strong> adds three kinds of very powerful torches that prevent mobs from spawning in a huge area. Only natural spawns will be prevented, so e.g. spawners and raids still work as they should.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C2JV3xu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The type of magnum torch you craft defines what kind of mobs will be prevented from spawning. Only new mobs are prevented from spawning, mobs already in the world will not instantly vanish upon placing a magnum torch!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Diamond:</strong> All monsters, such as zombies, skeletons, creepers, spiders, phantoms and so on.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Emerald:</strong> Passive mobs such as wandering traders and trader llamas (animals are technically affected, but not really, since they only spawn during world gen or from breeding, which are both unaffected by magnum torches)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Amethyst:</strong> Cave and water mobs, such as bats, all squids, axolotls, and all fish</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Even better: Every kind of magnum torch is fully customizable, including effective range, shape to prevent mob spawns in (cuboid, cylinder, ellipsoid), white-/blacklist for individual mobs, type of blocked mobs (monster/water/cave/passive). So if you want you can completely change what the different types do, e.g. have one type only prevent phantom spawns and another solely deal with wandering traders, while the third one disables all kinds of fish. Its completely up to you!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C2JV3xu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/542/2022-03-12_15.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/543/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Three kinds of magnum torches, all prevent different mob spawns</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Emerald magnum torch in a village</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/544/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/545/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>The item tooltip tells you all important variables you need to know</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Crafting a diamond magnum torch</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/546/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/547/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Crafting an emerald magnum torch</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Crafting an amethyst magnum torch</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C2JV3xu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented.

Skills\n\n![Banner](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/hqQqvaa4/images/0c83e356742665cdbdbee07cab069868fffa0797.png)\n\n[![Discord](https://puffish.net/badges/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/F4EKxzW4hf)\n\n## About\n\nPufferfish's Skills is a mod that adds a framework to create fully configurable skill systems. It has a dedicated [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/) to help building skills layout. There is also an API which allows extending the functionality and managing skills.\n\n## Latest changes (Important)\n\nIn the recent update the mod was split, the core part is [Pufferfish's Skills](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills). Attributes are a separate mod [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-attributes). The default skill trees were also removed, but can still be downloaded as a data pack [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees).\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe easiest way is to download [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees) data pack. You can modify it according to your needs. Most skills in that trees increase player attributes. In the game there isn't many of them and that's why there is a [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills) mod which used to be a part of the mod.\n\n## Commands\n\n`/puffish_skills points add <player> <category> <count>` - Adds points.\n\n`/puffish_skills points set <player> <category> <count>` - Sets points.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience add <player> <category> <amount>` - Adds experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience set <player> <category> <amount>` - Sets experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills unlock <player> <category> <skill>` - Unlocks skill.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills reset <player> <category>` - Locks all skills, points are refunded.\n\n`/puffish_skills category lock <player> <category>` - Locks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category unlock <player> <category>` - Unlocks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category erase <player> <category>` - Resets points, experience, skills.\n\n## Default keybindings\n\n`k` - Opens skills screen.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is JSON driven. It is possible to reload in without restarting game using `/reload` command.\n\nTo easily edit skills you can use [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/).\n\nYou can read more about configuration in the [documentation](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/docs/).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. What's more it is cross-compatible, so the client can use different loader than the server.\n\nThis mod should not conflict with other mods. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.\n\n## Community-made tutorials\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>Videos</summary>\n\t<iframe

mods.</p>\n<p><b>For all my mod devs out there - </b>This provides a lot of useful stuff, especially if you're a worldgen modder!</p>\n<p>The API includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure.

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-06-20T12:20:10.721384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":7457554,"followers":9860,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF","g2qXxjsR","fsK2ycFx","OC4JOVBe","my7uONjU","p25IJhj0","5a3sPIH2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":3006350,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5","sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods\\appliedenergistics2-fabric-15.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"824c95994f8fa8d47135c30d058132561f3571454a635e8952cd15e6c40ce3568a6bca516ee795eadbedcf646091044e0d4aa425716c5401f7e5b18a8257c967","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XxWD5pD3","slug":"ae2","project_type":"mod","team":"CqWdb4w5","title":"Applied Energistics 2","description":"AE2: A popular automation and storage mod","body":"Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management. It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-06-19T22:52:08.531564Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":558125,"followers":545,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W","NoFBkXQe","9Vscdpuz","CEmkqbKV","qpG9cRjY","fZYI0nmw","mfB8KDaB","L3u3Zbmr","Fx9uV7AL","eQcAHHqJ","4AsGT2cN","WTviSGxg","Q6wAB4Fm","RyqiiHUt","NsFt2Dws","G13uBrme"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qpG9cRjY","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":true,"name":"AE2

Developers\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0\n-->\n\n# ![CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/logo.png)\nCC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. A fork of the much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new features.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> I'm not sure what that is [...] I don't know where that came from.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, December 2020](https://youtu.be/D8Ue9I-SKeM?t=980)\n\n> It is basically ComputerCraft. It has the turtles, and the computers, and writing Lua programs and all that stuff.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, May 2022](https://youtu.be/7Ruq33XmQIQ?t=537)\n\n\n## Features\nControlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start\nwriting code and automating your Minecraft world.\n\n![A ComputerCraft terminal open and ready to be programmed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/basic-terminal.png)\n\nWhile computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the\nsolution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub]. If you've got any ideas, feedback or bugs please do [create an issue][bug].\n\n[github]: https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/ \"CC: Tweaked on GitHub\"\n[bug]: https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/issues/new/choose\n[computercraft]: https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft \"ComputerCraft on GitHub\"\n[lua]: https://www.lua.org/ \"Lua's main website\"\n[GitHub Discussions]: https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/discussions\n[IRC]: http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=computercraft \"#computercraft on EsperNet\"\n","published":"2021-06-09T10:54:33.958183Z","updated":"2024-05-28T17:48:47.248201Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":306879,"followers":293,"categories":["technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.4.7","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WqeySHnJ","vs6rHRcl","Y8BROcpZ","jOyg0yYV","pBsBWmkc","zjK368Q5","NIBkZSac","gMLY66zv","43RfBIDo","VrwUv7J7","xl0YcqPc","bp3jbJDY","ygcQddQK","HOWrWufQ","8ojt9zY3","XYnYJbya","DoaxaGS6","hF91LJA6","ouX7FCAZ","zw8ojSL6","RXtzxJtk","pediI4dL","lYGZ8ZwT","DgjRdqJd","bCL6z5TW","R0lf6e1y","OsGUkZ6Q","2W3boAIr","nNoVyofi","TEKjqEBB","T9ESTpOs","OYdVGyeX","d6n1eZ0J","NA2ivd3B","C3N6yktB","AEQHbsVP","UAPbUKzy","mqc8ASM7","iABSz6bl","fUJCmDE9","eAz3e5Gb","9H9NwyCo","a27kOHPh","piNwKQPi","ucPzeYU4","MzIscuX7","naU3mFep","gcwQagho","BT0uFNUO","eOTkJcwY","GSlojaVd","2QUc7mK5","ebHpC9cV","T06wzliQ","eGjixIog","kzYmI0uK","tQ0yfqKO","iIyiUM5S","ciZIstX5","PuSWa160","ySDtD4KE","YtTRD2cT","Uq4DlqWv","uTqLh5vj","IPsqMBvF","SG3YXVWw","N6c5v0mo","AqAOcTau","szgGZGGC","fmRxKFx2","pCQZNkje","HSDczg9J","K7Koq3s9","juKq8uHM","IhnfK2Qp","RGZaLxtv","chpzKoIz","MPg1gYz8","lrMrt7lC","3UcpWeKa","h7LA3APd","SFMZ4XzF","BexXatKb","mtL4uUWR","LS3REzLT","LqBYIKkR","cbZwvViH","s6Ov3R0y","ErHjhhds","bujb6KQ8","1m9ehiaf","f5nkHDvi","taNGLI3t","vbxbRgX4","f7EasAEd","mj74O5Dp","7RnsCpDD","kD0PJnrR","rylRmKaY","N3JZqWvT","oDSIlQfL","DPXiliyS","6sOV3urJ","Scean3uO","pEYhmeUL","7Dp2KNIa","mffxWP7D","qYsgokjg","TIcIRRWa","Y1gkoVaM","8hOJX080","q5J48Zgc","E86SrPLm","V24gQhXf","X7MARvdR","3gEfXO5g","lFENOl2Q","USCud6VB","s9kNfFYr","augSR8tA","KVPU2C6M","wZ1pAuRe","jjxUkmGK","8mNelbCW","FNkejxM5","afcOmjVN","lWo1QSZw","ekffpGYP","IiokbtKM","7U8gSlIr","MlxrTZqO","eMzJxUoQ","AzR4jXsO","nboVyuCa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu7yAYhd/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"MlxrTZqO","project_id":"gu7yAYhd","author_id":"GVvUpZBt","featured":false,"name":"1.111.0","version_number":"1.111.0","changelog":"Release notes can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/releases/tag/v1.20.1-1.111.0).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-28T17:22:22.041678Z","downloads":6512,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6ca3783b0734e25ab09f0a109cc4709d2495221b343d7c21dd94208191312ff2b0ebc68a3284fc36315040cb5ebc5edc79a09a9330fb5a16f18ac7a31fe0573d","sha1":"74af3d15232d46a66cdbeef7bdaed4b544a30b5d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu7yAYhd/versions/MlxrTZqO/cc-tweaked-1.20.1-fabric-1.111.0.jar","filename":"cc-tweaked-1.20.1-fabric-1.111.0.jar","primary":true,"size":3382023,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xob83kJz","user":{"id":"GVvUpZBt","username":"squiddev","name":"Jonathan Coates","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346137?v=4","bio":"Cephalopod Developer","created":"2021-06-09T10:48:31.786051Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"cc-tweaked-1.20.1-fabric-1.111.0.jar"},"mods\\yosbr-0.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"254f2225f6446523aa8c8274e83b31e27f3b2afc8fe4f490fb1b169dd518e10c7993acda5db0ab597474ddf9d69506b5e794242fada1e2f89ed7bf9d412a8f78","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"WwbubTsV","slug":"yosbr","project_type":"mod","team":"GBU3scgV","title":"Your Options Shall Be Respected (YOSBR)","description":"Your options shall be respected.","body":"Your options shall be respected, brought to you by the \"Association for Options Rights\" gang.\n\nThis mod has one simple function, to provide default options if the corresponding option file doesn't exist.\n\n### Example 1 (options.txt)\n\nCreate /config/yosbr/options.txt\nPut default content in it\nLaunch game!

stays in the same direction when the train turns, giving the appearance that the player themselves are turning. This mod turns the player's camera with the train they're riding to provide more immersion. This mod also applies \"lean\" and \"roll\" to the player when the train is on a slope.\n\nThe mod should also work while standing on the train, though this functionality is a bit experimental at the moment (and horribly unsafe). If you have any issues (with the mod), [remember to report them!](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues)\n\n**Notice:** This mod may cause motion sickness.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons","published":"2022-01-23T05:46:55.026356Z","updated":"2024-06-08T03:07:04.804360Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1152994,"followers":4266,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["wTtGd14B","DezAJ8u0","x3yEpy5p","ruuHY8OM","2vU5aacx","28PMiKSx","JseXmZpZ","AHJ0mNv1","k5oJ58yR","JV4jiA1y","qLXa9pDD","FnXdZRJ7","z6ZQBfWx","Pn7d9p7i","KrGwvvWA","6ZzUWKxi","KEWnNiUP","8ctYpkCM","QdxhQapq","McgrFayO","ArHY9dmV","38p3qCjb","yEUygWBv","P4psgCf3","xBHpiuwg","qT4v0LBa","QLrBlpYY","mxvQyywi","oYqpZUCe","yqCZe843","f5ukM1Qm","mjIVHovM","zhP09epG","nLshnREE","s3sNOqn2","aOWEQ1nc","r8OABIpt","fAVxiMK6","3yoHVgxZ","6pQHeelV","VnKmHe1I","P8tkVBXd","XLWDF2NT","hsb0wIeu","xbRHd92j","3B15sgvb","HbiwjG8y","13xaVT4W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uCdwusMi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"xbRHd92j","project_id":"uCdwusMi","author_id":"ksmgF6Gt","featured":true,"name":"2.1.0-a -

There were a number of issues rendering entities and it only ever worked on Fabric.\n- Near and near/far fog options - James\n\t- Near fog was originally added back in DH 1.0 in case we couldn't remove vanilla fog, which has since proven to not be an issue.\n- Remove Unlimited horizontal quality (LOD Dropoff Distance) setting - James\n\t- Unlimited quality is unnecessary and due to how the renderer is currently set up, unable to be run on any machine at higher render distances.\n- Disable cave culling for any detail level above 0 - James\n\t- Cave culling is currently bugged and to prevent holes in the ocean that show the void this is the temporary solution.\n\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-08T02:34:16.725379Z","downloads":82616,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"aa88befed67304efc24a536104f88feb9bae5cd278f400ca2588804d1d1c3e307059b4de85e5c7430e2ccda0116d79bae8770696d67cee4a59b0ed17a643796b","sha1":"c75221af6d258d9e2f57a7a6e6f8b999d753b0cc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uCdwusMi/versions/xbRHd92j/DistantHorizons-2.1.0-a-1.20.1.jar","filename":"DistantHorizons-2.1.0-a-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":16462213,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FulsV5Ai","user":{"id":"8JHQCjcE","username":"Ran","name":"Ran","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43445785?v=4","bio":"me code","created":"2022-01-04T15:43:45.930594Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"FulsV5Ai","user":{"id":"3OUZnTJl","username":"TomTheFurry","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46843632?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-10T04:51:41.298374Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"FulsV5Ai","user":{"id":"ce6koaec","username":"coolGi","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57488297?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-11-03T09:24:34.747769Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"FulsV5Ai","user":{"id":"5X6ZGAc6","username":"cola98765","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10381827?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-10T14:50:36.412306Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"FulsV5Ai","user":{"id":"79qC4h7K","username":"Morippi","name":"Leonardo Amato","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36246252?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-09T07:24:20.290185Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"FulsV5Ai","user":{"id":"ksmgF6Gt","username":"jeseibel","name":"James Seibel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85203568?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-01-23T05:33:12.763647Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"DistantHorizons-2.1.0-a-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\ae2-emi-crafting-1.3.1.jar":{"sha512":"51fdb5e5fa57275b9b87b315d791e92633453f2d9880d8cd6cccc25f785264d1d4781c8bfd2521a6e84588c50ab036189dba1f18df9e8f801a600c63076f2568","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"eVAp8Nkw","slug":"ae2-emi-crafting","project_type":"mod","team":"dNQUUrSZ","title":"AE2 EMI Crafting Integration","description":"Adds support for crafting with EMI on Applied Energistics 2 terminals","body":"# AE2 EMI Crafting Integration\n\nIt does what it says in the tin and nothing more.\n\nAs of **[v:1.3.0]** this mod is a *full backport* of the __official__ AppEng EMI plugin.  \n\nItems inside an AppEng terminal are shown on EMI, and they can used for crafting.\n\nAll EMI functionality you'd expect from a vanilla crafting table also should work, including but not limited to:\n\n- Shift-Clicking recipes\n- Viewing which items are available on the recipe tree\n- Bringing items from *all available inventories*, **including** your hotbar\n- Support for tags, prioritizing the item you have the most of on the AE2 system\n- **[v:1.2.1]** Support for Fluid Crafting\n- **[v:1.2.1]** Support for Dragging Items from EMI\n- **[v:1.2.1]** Support for Auto-Filling Crafting Patterns\n- **[v:1.2.1]** Support for Auto-Filling Processing Patterns (including fluids)\n- **[v:1.3.0]** Syncing AE2 and EMI search\n- **[v:1.3.0]** Requesting existing crafting patterns with Ctrl + Click\n- **[v:1.3.0]** Full Applied Energistics 2 Recipes Support\n\n\n## Cross-Mod Integration\n### **[v:1.3.0]** [Extra Mod Integrations](https://modrinth.com/modextra-mod-integrations)\nThe ExMI AE2 plugin gets automatically disabled if found which removes the duplicate recipes from applied energistics.\n\nThis mod has integrations for both AE2 and AE2WTLib.\n\n## Support Matrix\n\n| Minecraft Version | AppEng2 | AE2WTLib |\n|-------------------|---------|----------|\n| 1.20.1 (Fabric)   | ✅       | ✅        |\n\n## Previous Work\n\nThis is a non-comprehensive list of mods which inspired or helped with the implementation of this mod.\n\nleo60228's [emplied](https://modrinth.com/mod/emplied) -

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:35:16.889386Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1308377,"followers":874,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF","iKVUNCME","i3FZxFQO","h0hKeaRD","85t1ZpLC","vl2NraaO","TsIZU7vG","KYGTUMOq","iYliEQKf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"XGW2fviP","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":false,"name":"1.10.53 (Fabric 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-fabric","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

In future versions, such bonus doors will be rarely found in dungeon chests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Rifts</span></h2>\n<p>Rifts are fractal-shaped tears in the world. They form when a dimensional door is destroyed and is no longer binding together the fabric of reality. To pass through a rift, you can either place a dimensional door on it, or right click it using the rift blade.</p>\n<p>They also form naturally in extremely rare formations called \"Rift Clusters\", which lead to other very far away clusters.</p>\n<p>Rifts will grow logarithmically over time. You can use a rift remover to close rifts that got too big, or a rift stabilizer to stop a rift's growth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Tools and weapons</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Rift signature:</strong> Creates a pair of rifts linked to each other</p>\n<p>Stabilized rift signature: First click binds it to a location, other clicks create rifts leading to that location.</p>\n<p><strong>Rift removed:</strong> Used to close rifts</p>\n<p><strong>Rift stabilizer:</strong> Stops the growth of a rift</p>\n<p><strong>Rift blade:</strong> Teleports the entity you're attacking several blocks away. Right-clicking on a rift causes you to enter it, without having to use a door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Dungeons</span></h2>\n<p>Dungeons are special kinds of pocket dimensions filled with treasures, puzzles, traps, and dimensional doors leading to deeper dungeons. Although it might be tempting to break walls and bypass a puzzle, be careful of monoliths that may be waiting right outside those walls to teleport you to limbo!</p>\n<p>A dungeon can either be entered using a gateway, a rare structure that can be found throughout the world, or by using a gold dimensional door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Fabric of reality</span></h2>\n<p>Fabric is the material out of which dungeons are made. It comes in several variations:</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric of Reality:</strong> Completely black block that absorbs all light. It can be replaced by right clicking with a block, or mined using a silk touch pickaxe. Be careful, this looks exactly like the void in dungeons!</p>\n<p><strong>Altered Fabric:</strong> Fabric of reality that has been altered to become white, or any other color. White altered fabric is found in personal pocket dimensions. Other colors can be crafted by combining Fabric of Reality with a dye.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancient Fabric:</strong>&nbsp;Black bedrock-like fabric that surrounds some pocket dungeons</p>\n<p><strong>Altered Ancient Fabric:</strong> Colored variations of Eternal Fabric. It is uncraftable since eternal fabric is unobtainable, but the white one is found in personal pockets.</p>\n<p><strong>Eternal Fluid:</strong> Found deep in Limbo, providing a way for players stuck in Limbo to escape</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Limbo</span></h2>\n<p>A dark, foggy, and mysterious dimension filled with monoliths, where players who died or tried to cheat in a dungeon end up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 36px;\">F.A.Q.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Q: Why am I set on fire when leaving a Pocket Dimension?&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(Fixed in 1.17+ versions)</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">: It's a Vanilla bug.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

CodecConfig();\n\n    public final ConfigEntry<Integer> myInt =\n            register(\"my_int\", 0, Codec.INT);\n\n    public final ReadonlyConfigEntry<InnerCodecConfig> myInnerConfig =\n

// load\n        DataResult<JsonElement> encoded = this.encodeStart(JsonOps.INSTANCE); // save\n    }\n}\n```\nor in Kotlin...\n```kotlin\nobject CodecConfig : JsonFileCodecConfig(path) {\n    val myInt by register<Int>(0, Codec.INT)\n    \n    val myInnerConfig by register(InnerCodecConfig)\n    \n    fun test() {\n        loadFromFile()\n        saveToFile()\n        \n        // blah blah blah\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Rewritten Kotlin DSL\n\nCompletely rewrote the Kotlin DSL!\n\n```kotlin\nYetAnotherConfigLib(\"namespace\") {\n    val category by categories.registering {\n        val option by rootOptions.registering<Int> {\n            controller = slider(range = 5..10)\n            binding(::thisProp, default)\n            \n            val otherOption by categories[\"category\"][\"group\"].futureRef<Boolean>()\n            otherOption.onReady { it.setAvailable(false) }\n        }\n        \n        // translation key is generated automagically\n        val label by rootOptions.registeringLabel\n        \n        val group by groups.registering {\n            val otherOption = options.register<Boolean>(\"otherOption\") {\n                controller

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces.

quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.

errors with mods this entire time, it's closed source nature making it especially hard to work with as a mod developer.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

☕️ Support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/daedelus \"\"), if you like my project\n\n# 🔮️ Features\n\nThis library introduces new Entity Attributes for powering magical abilities, for the following magic types (schools):\n\n- 🔮 Arcane\n- 🔥 Fire\n- ❄️ Frost\n- 💚 Healing\n- ⚡️ Lightning\n- 👻 Soul\n\n(Note: the design intent is to stay native to Minecraft, but establish Warcraft like magic schools. So no classic 4 element schools are implemented, besides fire.)\n\nThe library offers an API to query spell damage of an entity (based on its attributes, status effects, enchantments), and provides critical strike chance and multiplier. Critical striking is completely rng based, powered by secondary attributes.\n\n## 📦 Content\n\n### Entity Attributes:\n\n- Spell Power, one for each specific magic school (for example: `spell_power:fire`)\n- Spell critical chance (id: `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n- Spell critical damage (id: `spell_power:critical_damage`)\n- Spell haste (id: `spell_power:haste`), can be used to quicken spell casting or cooldowns\n\n### Status Effects:\n\n- One specifically for each introduced attribute, with a matching id (for example: `spell_power:fire`, `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n\n(All status effects come with fancy icons 😍)\n\n### Enchantments:\n\n- Universal Spell Power (named: \"Spell Power\"), increasing all spell damage\n- School limited Spell Power (for example: \"Sunfire\", increasing arcane and fire damage) \n- Secondary attribute enchantments (for example: \"Spell Critical Chance\")\n- \"Magic Protection\" (totally symmetric to Projectile Protection, but for magic)\n\n(All enchantments are fully configurable, and come with descriptions)\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.\n","published":"2022-12-23T13:31:08.411187Z","updated":"2024-06-15T20:35:17.304990Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":487085,"followers":161,"categories":["library","magic"],"additional_categories":["adventure","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["OZt33z9y","8JZtHM36","FOc76ayi","ZIFDdYy8","Wzpqt33L","bE2Cpn06","wBSzMSuf","QMJuz1zi","7SbZEqA5","tuww90Eu","o5zzsgPA","6ffjOgGW","71FZTu9s","e2ggpysz","3e4ctFvH","aSo9SZuM","lME8r1AD","4b3xYbpW","LVyrxDzP","jHaKmMkR","wjkzk05R","uKb21LI4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8ooWzSQP/eac53d793cb13193c3860d90c5e19e680fbc7cb5.png"},"version":{"id":"wjkzk05R","project_id":"8ooWzSQP","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"0.10.2+1.20.1","version_number":"0.10.2+1.20.1","changelog":"# 0.10.2\n\nAPI Changes:\n- BREAKING!

Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.
