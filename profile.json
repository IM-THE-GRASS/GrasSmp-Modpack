Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur.

It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric

can configure which types of leaf blocks will drop leaves and the frequency that these leaves are dropped at.  \n  \nRequires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y6zGq33.gif)\n\nThis mod was brought over from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric), where all previous versions can be found.\n\n## Troubleshooting aka \"Why are no leaves falling?\"\n\nSome trees do not drop leaves by default, these are: conifer trees (like spruce and pine), large leaved trees (like jungle trees and palms) and shrubs.\n\nYou can change this as you like by adjusting \"Conifer Leaf Spawn Rate\" in the Mod Menu settings and adjusting the spawn rates for specific trees under \"Leaf Block Settings\".\n\nA complete list of all conifer trees is found [here](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/blob/1.19/src/main/java/randommcsomethin/fallingleaves/config/ConfigDefaults.java#L9-L27) and a list of all trees with adjusted spawn rates is found [here](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/blob/1.19/src/main/java/randommcsomethin/fallingleaves/config/ConfigDefaults.java#L37-L62).\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Is this compatible with trees from other mods? What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\".

A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/LICENSE)\n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n[![Mod loader: Fabric]][fabric] \n\nA dynamic lights mod for Quilt and Fabric.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nIt's dark outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6968236,"followers":5085,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"frGGaFrx","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.5-1.20.1 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.5","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Backport latest build down to 1.20.1\r\n* Fix \"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\" sometimes showing up in logs\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.4-1.20.6...1.6.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-25T20:34:05.225978Z","downloads":76300,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3a671efcdd85c431c933b84868373afd05b5fc16","sha512":"00009f1762657d252fba9ac42d67f29376ec3e3082befebeba4a8d1635fd71f76f309ed766fa36d407213357d2f21ab6dc26cbe44ddac9d636cca9896a02111d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/frGGaFrx/entityculling-fabric-1.6.5-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.5-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":64981,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/poie5Iwy/107197d35f2df9a1b4f3f2c09ccbe65a1df9bd82.png","bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-04-29T20:44:11.845709Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6936802,"followers":9466,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2024-06-05T06:24:08.810656Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2352348,"followers":3156,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq","xeHyTMq8","Ihazqamt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":1088158,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5","sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar"},"mods\\fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"e71c12b81f10b42c06fac9719a2135c6d34f298fb12d926bce9aca6af8655b76ccb31dce9561543499a019e43e93cf4036dc051fe2a97ca2a8fe112f646a99a5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YBz7DOs8","slug":"fabricskyboxes","project_type":"mod","team":"fXSWgsrG","title":"FabricSkyboxes","description":"Allows resource packs to define custom skyboxes.","body":"# FabricSkyBoxes\nFabricSkyBoxes goes beyond the capabilities of OptiFine, offering an extensive range of custom skybox features that will transform your Minecraft experience.

It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2024-05-15T05:16:05.016498Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3904460,"followers":4859,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl","Fc7h8MWD","MfBeYvQa","84Zs6tNo","Ox1racg8","hI13Vg85"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"84Zs6tNo","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-15T05:15:11.429367Z","downloads":99137,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8996e74dfe96ee845bdd25e2fc5ec73a73073b2b7945693a6058182a19fd8486c4d7f03de87a3369fb73a912411b8f9061a93f0fef77c4d729157de2f31e96be","sha1":"15ad75d51f567c69308b91223454bacfd2eda7a5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/84Zs6tNo/continuity-3.0.0-beta.5%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1009252,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\sodium-extra-0.5.4+mc1.20.1-build.115.jar":{"sha512":"ab561186421776d0db506dcbf1a724f80b345be5769ff00aa4327161c79af6e3f353eb65345ce06da30546ffa6b43e1c4a4c41dd246b7e473b131fd727997a85","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PtjYWJkn","slug":"sodium-extra","project_type":"mod","team":"EfhDgRdO","title":"Sodium Extra","description":"A Sodium addon that adds features that shouldn't be in Sodium.","body":"# What is Sodium Extra?\nSodium Extra aims to bring most of OptiFine's eye-candy options to Sodium; in addition to providing some features such as visual bug fixes and other performance options that are not yet available on Sodium.\n\n# Features\nHere is a basic rundown of what this mod does.\n\n- Animations Settings (Control fire, water, lava, block animations and etc...)\n- Particles Settings (Control all types of particles, including ones from other mods)\n- Details Settings (Control sky, stars, sun/moon, weather, and much more)\n- Render Settings (Control fog, static entities, and other miscellaneous renderings)\n- Extra Settings (Display FPS, coordinates, toast notifications, clouds, and much more)\n\nSee a more detailed explanation of what features are included in Sodium Extra [here](https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/wiki/Features).\n\n# Modpack Permissions\nThis is a free and open-source project; you can include it in your mod pack as long as you provide attribution!\n\n# Common Questions\n- **Do I need Sodium installed for this mod to work?** You will need to download Sodium for this mod to work.\n- **Can I re-host/upload this mod somewhere else?** Yes, as long as you provide the mod source code.

It also gives server owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.\n\nThe mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side. The mod already integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) mods. Make sure to update them to the latest versions.\n\nThe API of the mod allows the implementation of player permission systems to be used by the mod for some permission nodes (e.g. for having rank-based claim limits), with Prometheus, FTB Ranks, LuckPerms and the Forge/Fabric permission APIs having built-in support. It also allows the implementation of party systems to be used by claims alongside or instead of the default party system, with Argonauts and FTB Teams having built-in support. The default party system or claims can be disabled completely in the main config file.\n\n## Commands:\n/openpac ... - player config commands\n\n/openpac-claims ... - everything claim-related\n\n/openpac-parties ... - everything party-related\n\n/opm - shortcut for the party chat\n\n## Key Bindings:\n' - open the mod UI. Can be changed in the controls menu.\n\n## Configs:\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - the usual location of the main config file. Make sure to shut down the server before editing it, or the server might overwrite all your changes.\n\n[server directory]/config/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - sometimes the location of the main config file on Fabric/Quilt.\n\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-... - some global \"player configs\", although all of them can be accessed in game through the UI\n\n## FAQ\n### 1) How do I configure the mod on my server?\nThe mod is mainly configured through the main config file at _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, or sometimes _[server directory]/config/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_ on Fabric/Quilt, while the server isn't running. Server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, can be edited by OPs in-game with the UI (check your key bindings). Normal players can configure their own player config with the same UI. If the mod isn't installed on the client side, then you can use the player config chat commands instead.\n\n### 2) How do I use this mod as a regular player?\nMost things related to claims can be accessed with the in-game UI (check your key bindings). If you have the Xaero's World Map mod installed, you can view and edit your claims on the map screen as well, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection. You can also use chat commands to make/edit claims. Parties can only be created and managed through chat commands at the moment.\n\n### 3) Why are some options greyed out in my player config?\nThe server admin/owner can configure with the main config file option _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_ which specific options players have access to. Everything else uses the value in the default player config.\n\n### 4) How do I disable all protection on my server?\nIn the server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, disable the main protection option. Next, edit the config file _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Remove the main option _claims.protectClaimedChunks_ from _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_.\n\n## Supported Mods:\nA lot of (usually smaller) mods should be supported by the claimed chunk protection automatically. Some mods go above and beyond with the mechanics they add to the game or modify, in which case chunk protection is not guaranteed and should be manually added, either to this mod or with an additional one. Feel free to leave suggestions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims/issues) for the mods that you'd like to be supported.

allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

Banner](https://rre36.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia-Banner.jpg)\n\n## **What is the Nostalgia Shader?**\nThis shaderpack is intended to reproduce the look and feel of the \"old\" shaderpacks from back when the shadersmod was new. However it also builds ontop of that with new features and superior performance. Accidentally it also has some similarities to the now cancelled \"Super Duper Graphics Pack\". \n\n## **What features does it offer?**\n* Dynamic soft shadows\n* Optional screen-space path-tracing (SSPT)\n* Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)\n* Vanilla style volumetric clouds with multiple cloud layers (the first of their kind)\n  * they also rely on the cloud texture provided by your resourcepack\n* Screen-space reflections and optional offscreen environment reflections (when enabling the reflection capture)\n* Volumetric fog\n* labPBR resourcepack support\n* Various optional lens effects such as depth of field, lens flares and vignette\nand many, many more.\n\n## **Any Requirements?**\n* OptiFine for 1.16 or newer or Iris 1.5.0 or newer\n* A graphics card that supports OpenGL 4.3 or newer\n*

Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":860582,"followers":834,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"Mkla4B3q","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:43.157958Z","downloads":376583,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f3858977becfbc26f67f4a5579881e15e07d69d","sha512":"ca96f56dba50ea4827ec7a15bc590ccb29aba01896550d3cb398bed18acdf469dd351cdc9312e4743f54955b3162e744c58d76c88eb79b1e5e5b4570f5b33c64"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/Mkla4B3q/carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":443033,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\CreativeCore_FABRIC_v2.11.30_mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"5e5242c9268c1db0de9167098b16c7f11666e485202705341289f997e69c32d7e281db0303a861e3187b0fe9d4e1e3f0bde5269221d7eaf4bbaf6943f20eccda","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OsZiaDHq","slug":"creativecore","project_type":"mod","team":"FvoHe2qM","title":"CreativeCore","description":"A core mod","body":"Nothing else than a simple core mod required by most of CreativeMD's mods.\n\n**Features**\n* Gui-Api\n* Config System (/cmdconfig or /cmdclientconfig)\n* Packet system (supports splitted packets)\n* Event system (by N247s)\n* Ingredients\n* Fake world\n\nI know everybody hates core mods, because it is an additional file you have to download, but it speeds up my progress.

Originally it was a part of [Pufferfish's Skills](https://modrinth.com/mod/skills) mod, but was split and now can be used independently.\n\n## Attributes\n\nSome attributes work different from vanilla ones. Instead of providing a value they modify dynamic values using addition or multiplication. For example damage dealt by attacking using various weapons. They work like normal attributes, but their base value is internally set to the dynamic value. Changing base value of these attributes is not possible, because it is permanently set to [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). These attributes are marked as dynamic in their description below.\n\n- Stamina\n- Melee Damage\n- Ranged damage\n- Fortune\n- Healing\n- Jump\n- Resistance\n- Mining Speed\n- Sprinting Speed\n- Knockback\n\n### Stamina\n\nAttribute `puffish_attributes:player.stamina` allows to change hard coded stamina value, which is 4 by default. Stamina determines how much exhaustion player must collect to decrease food/saturation points.\n\n### Melee Damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.melee_damage` modifies damage dealt using melee weapons.\n\n### Ranged damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.ranged_damage` modifies damage dealt using ranged weapons.\n\n### Fortune\n\nDynamic attribute  `puffish_attributes:player.fortune` modifies fortune when mining a block, also applies without having fortune enchant on the item.\n\n### Healing\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.healing` modifies how much health is restored by natural regeneration.\n\n### Jump\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.jump` modifies how high player can jump.\n\n### Resistance\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.resistance` modifies resistance of the player\n\n### Mining Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.mining_speed` modifies mining speed of the player.\n\n### Sprinting Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.sprinting_speed` modifies sprinting speed of the player.\n\n### Knockback\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.knockback` modifies knockback power of the player.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. It may conflict with other mods that add similar attributes. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n**It is incompatibility with every version below 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, because that versions includes everything that Pufferfish's Attributes adds. However, version 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, when released, will no longer contain Pufferfish's Attributes, therefore these mods will be compatible.**\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates are: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2, 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.","published":"2024-03-28T19:41:07.521172Z","updated":"2024-06-02T17:23:01.276929Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":12083,"followers":16,"categories":["game-mechanics","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["management"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["vjyrgZ4t","aEXrd6Gk","akYwrf2x","OwpspM8j","q1YNYX46","HtTHEvn5","2jVaBWQQ","KiBBrgIr","aowYX1Ng","w8DsSlyJ","kLlwnjhn","OMRHNS0p","eOzlYeYS","jZ6clufT","2mtm3wlX","7ZCWortj","1RMeTDan","RYphekww","TouzHJRA","89goX9JR","Zs11lNLI","mRqyVmZg","Hv1gf4f7","FWcjGg1K","tgtUFpm3","LfFhx9Iy","fQadECPH","uIfUdSKo","i8zbWbtl","AeGH5WvW","BeCYfSDL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/f25e0000aca9f043997af84f44d33099f7c6b8ef.png"},"version":{"id":"LfFhx9Iy","project_id":"FCFcFw09","author_id":"3fJOgX88","featured":false,"name":"Pufferfish's Attributes 0.3.0","version_number":"0.3.0","changelog":"- Improved compatibility.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-02T17:22:03.996997Z","downloads":1560,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"2f661ffc04fb0d4944a6c8245a831115ef7fe831","sha512":"60fc1dd3c1acba01d7576af1411be6c7094ad85380d78ed0fd5f2d86fdec69c4b8d85fe90593c8a1e9cfd6038cf8131a150ec6b94e77faac27722060f2b301eb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/versions/LfFhx9Iy/puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar","filename":"puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":22635,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L04V2Tpb","user":{"id":"3fJOgX88","username":"Pufferfish","name":"pufferfish","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82769502?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-28T22:28:22.642802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar"},"mods\\YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"010e9ca808de2172067ea1663cac27472e6dbbc76158e2b6808ee35b4f2b1decc9c4461c633b89d4357e66a2aaecf99c01f8b9c745192506ad06179fb251d672","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1eAoo2KR","slug":"yacl","project_type":"mod","team":"Nwpe87D0","title":"YetAnotherConfigLib","description":"A builder-based configuration library for Minecraft.","body":"# YetAnotherConfigLib\n\n![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)\n[![Java 17](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java%2017-9B599A.svg?color=orange)](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-17-2021-09-14)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/780023008668287017?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/1eAoo2KR?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)\n[![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_667299_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yacl)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/isxander)\n\nYet Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

Numismatics\n\nNumismatics is a brand-new currency mod that boasts easy-to-use systems for simple shops as well as leaving room for your wildest redstone-capitalism dreams.\n\n## Features\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layers-of-Railways/ImageDump/main/numismatics/vendor.png\" width=80/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layers-of-Railways/ImageDump/main/numismatics/creative_vendor.png\" width=80/>\n\n### Vendor\nQuick buying or selling of items, designed for compact player-run shops.\n\nCreative version allows server admins to setup infinitely-refilling shops.\n\n<br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layers-of-Railways/ImageDump/main/numismatics/bank_terminal.png\" width=80/>\n\n### Bank Terminal\nAccess your virtual bank account to deposit and withdraw coins.\n\n<br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layers-of-Railways/ImageDump/main/numismatics/andesite_depositor.png\" width=80/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layers-of-Railways/ImageDump/main/numismatics/brass_depositor.png\" width=80/>\n\n### Depositor\nSet a price and the depositor will emit a 1 redstone tick pulse once a player deposits money, either by having coins in their inventory or by using a card.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Coins\nThe backbone of the mod, with 6 different coins of various values to choose from.\n\n| Spur   | Bevel   | Sprocket | Cog      | Crown  | Sun     |\n| ------ | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |\n| 1 spur | 8 spurs | 16 spurs | 64 spurs | 8 cogs | 64 cogs |\n|

funds go directly into the associated account. Additionally, using a Bank Card on a Vendor or Depositor extracts funds from your account instead of taking coins from your inventory.\n\nID Cards are used to allow other players access to Numismatics' protected blocks (Vendors, Depositors, and Blaze Bankers), allowing you to easily give access to your business partners.\n\n<br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layers-of-Railways/ImageDump/main/numismatics/blaze_banker.png\" width=80/>\n\n### Blaze Banker\nIs one bank account not enough for your ~~tax evasion~~ business needs? Create another and use ID Cards to allow your business partners to withdraw funds.","published":"2023-07-17T00:29:02.201546Z","updated":"2024-05-26T20:04:27.968340Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":32293,"followers":123,"categories":["economy","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["OJfDE3t5","4ejmAA7R","P1ZPi7Kf","Dc33BHY6","A42gNzaQ","eHw94ZzW","WPYknzSp","LItgfJlx","OVbJYDP2","MuePo9UP","udqCcl52","ExoJ4bOE","95Ixqq5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Jdbbtt0i/d564adc868dd6702b9a0d031972cfab2d158f1ac.png"},"version":{"id":"ExoJ4bOE","project_id":"Jdbbtt0i","author_id":"2pSgrUlO","featured":false,"name":"Numismatics 1.0.6 Fabric 1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.6+fabric-mc1.20.1","changelog":"Numismatics 1.0.6:\n\nFixes\n- Fix IllegalAccessError on forge","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-26T20:04:24.087890Z","downloads":3451,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f260b34ad859c7bca0b554c14d6acb5c08a9257f","sha512":"cf9b0ecf404bfc9c18eaa9addca87ca5a17a046db6e9a16318854bfbf850f3c9e876a30a17d74feb40d9d8151c1da7494f1859a1c370624ee619cbdf1591512a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Jdbbtt0i/versions/ExoJ4bOE/CreateNumismatics-1.0.6%2Bfabric-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"CreateNumismatics-1.0.6+fabric-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":711147,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Xbc0uyRg","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hNaUwmvQ","user":{"id":"oID3YKEr","username":"spottytheturtle","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69260662?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-24T23:38:45.235391Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"hNaUwmvQ","user":{"id":"zbkokKcb","username":"SlimeistDev","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77073745?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-09T23:12:41.606254Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"hNaUwmvQ","user":{"id":"2pSgrUlO","username":"IThundxr","name":"IThundxr","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74031881?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-14T19:41:15.163217Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"CreateNumismatics-1.0.6+fabric-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\extra-mod-integrations-0.4.6+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"522ab113584aad6fad8cce70a4ec8d120119600af7553e8d4a457db21c378407234a3c53b3a4c08c3c32e3e2ffebbd5842292d4c89de857fa2ebdbedc7effbb4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"bpRHnWUb","slug":"extra-mod-integrations","project_type":"mod","team":"SSCo6k0T","title":"EMI Addon: Extra Mod Integrations","description":"EMI addon adding support for as many mods as possible","body":"# Extra Mod Integrations\n\nThis mod is an addon for the powerful, new recipe viewer [EMI].

Just press left click when cooking anything on a skillet or use a shovel on a placed down one!\n\n**🌽 Description**\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n \n**📖 Getting Started**\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>","published":"2024-03-27T01:59:37.106681Z","updated":"2024-04-28T21:45:16.520969Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":134180,"followers":153,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M8bp9Dk5","J5zT5dIA","UFctor0l","ETe2oDvK","FMhV8TQg","X6fzggyI","QzcIQ62s","pnmeqDCQ","6MKCnUff","Qid8WxOf","Ti8scSIz","5dZdVy3m"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7vxePowz/26e8448993e9bda4dba92b6e7a1a13d9c4333138.png"},"version":{"id":"5dZdVy3m","project_id":"7vxePowz","author_id":"84zsGbft","featured":false,"name":"Farmer's Delight Refabricated 2.1.1 -

This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-06-10T09:42:18.109519Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3870304,"followers":3573,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P","TsACcqoR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"48hFxWw7","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

About\n\nPufferfish's Skills is a mod that adds a framework to create fully configurable skill systems. It has a dedicated [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/) to help building skills layout. There is also an API which allows extending the functionality and managing skills.\n\n## Latest changes (Important)\n\nIn the recent update the mod was split, the core part is [Pufferfish's Skills](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills). Attributes are a separate mod [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-attributes). The default skill trees were also removed, but can still be downloaded as a data pack [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees).\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe easiest way is to download [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees) data pack. You can modify it according to your needs. Most skills in that trees increase player attributes. In the game there isn't many of them and that's why there is a [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills) mod which used to be a part of the mod.\n\n## Commands\n\n`/puffish_skills points add <player> <category> <count>` - Adds points.\n\n`/puffish_skills points set <player> <category> <count>` - Sets points.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience add <player> <category> <amount>` - Adds experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience set <player> <category> <amount>` - Sets experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills unlock <player> <category> <skill>` - Unlocks skill.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills reset <player> <category>` - Locks all skills, points are refunded.\n\n`/puffish_skills category lock <player> <category>` - Locks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category unlock <player> <category>` - Unlocks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category erase <player> <category>` - Resets points, experience, skills.\n\n## Default keybindings\n\n`k` - Opens skills screen.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is JSON driven. It is possible to reload in without restarting game using `/reload` command.\n\nTo easily edit skills you can use [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/).\n\nYou can read more about configuration in the [documentation](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/docs/).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. What's more it is cross-compatible, so the client can use different loader than the server.\n\nThis mod should not conflict with other mods. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.\n\n## Community-made tutorials\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>Videos</summary>\n\t<iframe

margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-04-29T16:00:45.150007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11379864,"followers":13506,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"mhZtY2lR","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

What does this mod replace?\nThis mod replaces many mods and implements fixes from some others\n\n- **[BetterShields](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettershields)**\n- **[Shift-Scroll Fix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shift-scroll-fix)**\n- **[ForgetMeChunk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgetmechunk)**\n-

[Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/debugify) • [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify) • [Patched bug list](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/blob/1.19/PATCHED.md) • [Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) -

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your

skin feature tool now has a setting to prevent ETF from adding the example template to your skin, thus no longer overwriting any extraneous pixels in your skin\n  - the skin tool now prompts users to set this setting when the skin tool first tries to apply one of the templates in a way that would override any extraneous skin pixels \n  - the templates have been broken up into several smaller

[Botarium](https://modrinth.com/mod/botarium) to work\n\nHere are the features features:\n- Electricity generation using large spinning copper coils with magnets.\n- Motors (Not just one motor!) which can generate rotation from electricity.\n- Energiser which lets you craft a few new items using rotation and electricity.\n- Multi block nuclear reactors which can easily generate tons of heat that can be used in Create's boilers to boil water for your steam engines.\n- Wires that allow one to transfer energy around easily.\n- Solar panels which can generate heat.\n- A heat system which allows you to transfer heat generated by solar panels and nuclear reactors to other places.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is this addon compatible with Create: Crafts & Additions?\nYes, the two addons should be able to work together.\n### I don't like some unrealistic parts of this mod, is there an easy way to remove them?\nThere is a datapack builtin into this mod called \"Create: New Age [Monkey Edition]\" which removes recipes for a few magnets, removes recipes for the first tiers of the energiser leaving only the last one, removes recipes for overcharged iron, gold and diamond as well as modifies the recipes that use them.\n### Can I configure this mod?\nYes.\n","published":"2023-08-16T17:31:04.749014Z","updated":"2024-02-04T17:48:50.435487Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":230623,"followers":171,"categories":["technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["m8YprJWF","w4tgCPFK","RCECmmih","Mgs69J99","B3pDiU3b","WzRb0DBJ","rWaKt59k","ao3q73HP","EZOMcIeF","CqRrkNGx","fxl3gvEu","WCDx7Wfc","jqMmLNLe","a6W08wcK","B7bCM6IZ","1PPcbRSB","ioExlpoB","7BLYh3Vj","9w7r8hfq","9VZpPXFq","HuzzzYL6","vMKWsHwr","tgLRjftY","hExvnyfK","dWpdPzIU","rrNIuoca","zco5jNBv","OHszECIT","UMQnwuOr","N9ynh7Qk","Za0g1RgO","Cz3GTbgJ","rvYVvldk","rk63oafd","bLna6SZ1","2BEeSV7E"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FTeXqI9v/fe75695f6f2e085ac9fb56204de7f88b6d716e8d.png"},"version":{"id":"rk63oafd","project_id":"FTeXqI9v","author_id":"kgc7JcMg","featured":true,"name":"v1.1.2

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config.

high.\n\nThis means more info visible at the same time, less scrolling, and a better overview.\n\nAlso, it checks out which requirements you've met and which you haven't, and displays a list of those to the right of the UI. This makes it much easier to find what you have done and what you still need to do.\n\nFor example, the \"Discover every Biome\" Advancement doesn't tell you what's still missing; this mod will help you go for that last biome you haven't visited.\n\nThis works with data pack Advancements as well; here's an example from BlazeAndCave:\n\n![Screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/images/18e15e0dd7ffa0a9e1eb5eaa85bf0fa1dabf0777.png \"Screenshot\")\n\nIf the list to the right overflows, you can use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvancements, and their objectives, have their very own names, which may or may not correspond to MineCraft items, blocks, or entities. The mod tries its best to map those names to Minecraft objects, but in some cases, especially with Data Packs, that's just not possible. The mod will show the internal name in that case in the hope you're better at deciphering what's needed than the mod itself. \n\nFor example, the objective of \"The Parrots and the Bats\" is named \"bred\", this will show as bred in the info box. \n\n\nThis is the very first version of the mod, and as such, there are probably still bugs. Please report them!\n\nTo make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft, \nit has been optimized using\n [![JProfiler Logo](https://www.ej-technologies.com/images/product_banners/jprofiler_small.png \"Logo\")](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).","published":"2020-12-10T07:16:17.383874Z","updated":"2023-12-17T17:32:25.748315Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1662496,"followers":1266,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.4","20w46a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","1.17-pre5","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w39a","21w40a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.18","1.18.2","1.19-pre2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w45a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7CcuXvo8","WdvJfoeZ","cG7TokqN","M4TW1uhs","HILGlO18","tAekKEwa","kK2M3xop","6Em9IM5o","KIh7C2jj","UjVVEDzy","46lPmfqC","J2iSDOlC","ehJF8nc8","GMo7T4Xo","KPQY6mZp","irVcytpD","SjmQw2Uq","ktAuncew","X9P1aArG","B7tL3HcK","sVKaNGOr","9kObxiCk","CeaKOPoo","82WU0RPm","VfkzAPDA","Byz7gNoU","LCurb3dX","ULrQ3wMt","VJQWYcDz","u96MLURP","p4psnBkA","FwuDY3z5","HkMtkEM2","FURXdWNB","KeVl7NVo","gfcbMV82","NhssqIwa","gq5isc7f"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"gfcbMV82","project_id":"G1epq3jN","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"advancementinfo","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-28T12:19:38.294528Z","downloads":1010668,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"dfa603a2db09d6e303dd2991f016550ae156e3d1","sha512":"ff10a77f831354f757c1ba4b6906e612549f3ac0dd3b15101dae29a459937bfceabe5e7ce7cd9126e58833a69e5a4ba04993dfcf2098830b9ccf2c192dddc0e5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/versions/gfcbMV82/advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar","filename":"advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":43895,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"KfkhaGhb","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar"},"mods\\YungsBetterStrongholds-1.20-Fabric-4.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"e70c8daa91e88d8af97e99201264c9646c82a8cf1966b87ca1e53b591e7f1ed3cee2f8875dbe88f9b58e2a7d151fded34896bb4bd23f33f2bfef4c590fbba850","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kidLKymU","slug":"yungs-better-strongholds","project_type":"mod","team":"2OSJ0L4h","title":"YUNG's Better Strongholds","description":"A complete redesign of Minecraft's strongholds!","body":"<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xorwZ5Z.png\" alt=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" width=\"1344\" height=\"416\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsapibadge\" alt=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" width=\"211\" height=\"26\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" href=\"https://discord.gg/rns3beq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsdiscordbadge2\" alt=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" width=\"136\" height=\"28\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungstwitterbadge3\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" width=\"104\" height=\"37\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsyoutubebadge\" alt=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Support me on Patreon!\" href=\"https://patreon.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungspatreonbadge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon!\" width=\"138\" height=\"28\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ePR2LMC.png\" alt=\"What is this?\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nA complete redesign of Minecraft strongholds like never before, making them much more complex and exciting while still staying true to vanilla themes.

through signs and item frames to chests","body":" **Mod on hold warning**\n \n I haven't played Minecraft since 1.16, but I kept my mods updated because people wanted them. Unfortunately, Minecraft changed a lot of internals with 1.19.4, and updating isn't just a matter of changing a few things, it'll also mean figuring out a lot about how it works now. I currently don't have the time and energy to do this, so there won't be a 1.19.4 update in the forseeable future. Sorry for that to everybody who uses my mods.\n \n Some mods (which don't use a gui) will still work, but everything that has a settings or configuration screen won't, so you might still see updates to some of my mods.\n \nAs long as you don't use the config screen, the 1.19.3 version of the mod should still work on 1.19.4.\n\n\nThis mod helps you access containers (chests, shulker boxes, barrels, but also hoppers, dispensers, ...) that are marked with a sign or item frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.\n\nUnlike other similar mods, it's purely client side, so it works on any kind of server - vanilla, modded, or spigot/paper.\n\nYou can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.\n\nThe same goes for signs that have some functionality attached by the server, for example, buy/sell signs on a server that has ChestShop or a similar plugin enabled.","published":"2020-12-12T11:44:27.908567Z","updated":"2024-01-27T12:18:32.473416Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":559754,"followers":1170,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","1.17-pre5","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w39a","21w40a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.18","1.18.2","1.19-pre2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w45a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["h8bGqEhA","VFVct0Df","RAzzHtvo","wYbG1TyG","nxb14Kj8","TDeFdTIS","8o51G2i7","3htKSYvl","C5dkN3yQ","SL26Gyb3","j1JBpo8z","pUmH0Qp4","jSyFHCqu","sSSxl0Ai","jEUeKqWP","peyOaYw9","ZyygREAD","Anv6Fp5Z","Kbn1lNJL","14C7wPMc","bJf4bGiY","s6eVSN6f","puyruYCG","EZAA7MCl","Dz6XIgB2","YQDVV9kV","Rxkd5QRH","BBRbJ4Fd","ZMcunEOm","17Qfgj2T","APnhH1uF","bwQT3Pqa","7BwF68rg","kJBinEft"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z5b0cAlD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"bwQT3Pqa","project_id":"Z5b0cAlD","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"clickthrough","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1","changelog":"Fix the error message from modmenu when configuring\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-30T07:35:09.841499Z","downloads":249191,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"11b75d1cb1c1d220c180e674156a8e67b4c5cb5f8a2664ab1867be38b947efce029924d1cb28394dbde8d5f8bfceeb7d1a34b3449a298383481227490ec33bbd","sha1":"af4fab0a71ef09870c724a22036437070fb54952"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z5b0cAlD/versions/bwQT3Pqa/clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar","filename":"clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar","primary":true,"size":95682,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Oab6ZkPT","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar"},"mods\\indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Orvt0mRa","slug":"indium","project_type":"mod","team":"X5s94xjx","title":"Indium","description":"Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-06-10T18:21:07.198867Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":5196623,"followers":6029,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7","VlLxDisa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":false,"name":"Indium 1.0.30 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Also allow 1.20.1 (fixes #277) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-06T00:32:27.223998Z","downloads":1811960,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b24233f29c0ce4802c61ea8998e01e6e4580ae60","sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Aouse6P7/indium-1.0.30%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":104805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"VlLxDisa","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.31 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.31+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Bump version, remove 1.20.2 as supported Minecraft version (comp500)\n- Merge pull request #295 from PepperCode1/pr/1.20.x/main/fix-model-offset (comp500)\n- Fix non-terrain model offset (PepperCode1)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.31+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-10T18:21:08.640568Z","downloads":9415,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fe6d0513ac332d890f1bd9bb9354a8e240b8f0e5","sha512":"27b4a73ca990742e27eee4348553c86c96c19fddcd0763892029f67ddbde42dc03c0ac21230403ae6b4ce4da315d0d49f582d3daab413b9ea84fd6d172ee7c4f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/VlLxDisa/indium-1.0.31%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.31+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":105350,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\CreateUnbreakableTools-1.2+fabric-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"42299255104f1787c8d218837175f2cb0a9bdbc2d964204ceef4c785f92cc893117fc89e51e475cff791e501427eb254600cfb21677d9e8558d269af0b85fa77","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"bzzq7Auj","slug":"create_unbreakable","project_type":"mod","team":"JhYNHper","title":"Create: Unbreakable Tools","description":"This is an addon mod for Create that provides a way to make your tools unbreakable.","body":"# Create: Unbreakable Tools\n\nThis is an addon mod for Create that provides a way to make your tools unbreakable.\n\n## Recipe\n\n![Irromolding Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/fC5p3Ra.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo make your tools unbreakable, follow the recipe above.

It brings many new features, and optimizes for the user experience. Outside of the standard Fabric/Quilt API, EMI requires **zero** dependencies, and can be launched with the game simply and easily.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/0d3b5b33d0016b21834ce6f3602169f7c48de13f.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/f3c8b452eae6dde028c37e3a3e3792459468d865.png)\n\n## Runtime JEI Compat\nFor runtime JEI compat, all you need to do is install JEI alongside EMI and they will work together to share recipes. JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material

(16kb to ~8kb)\n- Removed Fabric API dependency as it wasn’t used.\n- Removes Fabric Loader as a dependency for better quilt compatibility.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-no-fade/assets/images/demo.gif)\n\n**This is a fork of [no fade](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-fade).

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-06-08T14:59:35.800078Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1689097,"followers":472,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB","7r8TleZN","GaHAWKFN","aoXpagIV","5Ic61SOJ","Y2coeQBy","wldQnfTY","WRTGYYwK","rL76IQAG","kWp5Y5C9","FSr3bS7l","g1NYtQkD","sBdauEYc","jwHI7W1V","Hrg4AXGA","cP4hkgv1","CUoXbepB","zRXo9SbS","zYK4kSID","7X9Ap8XG","OS1Spie4","nOP9IgtT","qZEcqr3j","H78hNSMP","u5W05Nll","uKalHaQF","DCYqLiyn","yui9wjUi","vivHKObd","2RDhJhN7","unsnRxp1","elfXvPlb","QplPUcMZ","o50IGtrs","SBI44BXf","CV8lDNyD","2O5fg0oB","JEGquuvM","kxiwYQnp","tAnlg8ff","tNmV8F3e","bIIUFcYw","WOsQY4RE","qDW4WXAw","p6nioh9J","XdWNv88P","DoxaOeBf","fLxJRzSX","cdNu7PK8","l53OchaO","ZloMzYX2","luqVInL6","c1lxzTbA","ZOqeyUiV","ej91c9V8","93Yehddj","7saLSGbf","OOWX2Oij","Funmd64I","LazriRXO","oM4tZMNR","mrMZDCEp","dYm8xmxC","qaPBcEwV","W3TFpB71","xAoofRnn","uv4zha4H","erMSGCtZ","TrNPp0VJ","syE4OiG7","3WzCZus7","P1OnKMWx","z5otFTC5","EghVG3Df","4aP9Rkxt","X5QZyeHj","N9LlGRuD","yqHXozvj","rPFKzJR5","arDcM3bX","jzdBancr","mPucwDC

mods.</p>\n<p><b>For all my mod devs out there - </b>This provides a lot of useful stuff, especially if you're a worldgen modder!</p>\n<p>The API includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure.

work.\n","published":"2022-05-02T09:52:47.910376Z","updated":"2024-04-24T21:28:21.785999Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1682132,"followers":642,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["LICx0kWh","W7KZowlh","GlXDrxTY","jvJfecx9","2zE7dj3R","bds6PhCr","LjxrGjwN","KWUgM1Pm","EmeZ0Gqt","SBi7COdt","enCs35o3","QNaBS24G","o5KsFiVJ","WwSxteqI","w1ctchwV","DvWsedjb","IDfdFriT","KaUaJJ1i","jdW6CBhM","RMa6KMf9","HpDkLZjj","bqQWHwWx","ehlFpVEb","3uGk4ChO","eM7FKWWG","L99Bxt2Y","2oUHeIhM","v4BLjO6F","vJb4cpaY","TM9YqUwX","EOU9oC3S","LVdJJtmU","XflepaVP","P6myMR8K","xQrH4kWR","YU9Yi2mO","41AoOR3G","3CSEKfcd","x0k8u61W","noPVqZnY","rBFq3aQs","xpfegZsE","cGrREnKA","pUVuXS69","2FbON5jl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/2ec739011e612256ebe0c79a4ce064d0e453dd0f.png"},"version":{"id":"xpfegZsE","project_id":"JuksLGBQ","author_id":"PpKojnYx","featured":false,"name":"OptiGUI

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers.

game. A fork of the much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new features.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> I'm not sure what that is [...] I don't know where that came from.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, December 2020](https://youtu.be/D8Ue9I-SKeM?t=980)\n\n> It is basically ComputerCraft. It has the turtles, and the computers, and writing Lua programs and all that stuff.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, May 2022](https://youtu.be/7Ruq33XmQIQ?t=537)\n\n\n## Features\nControlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start\nwriting code and automating your Minecraft world.\n\n![A ComputerCraft terminal open and ready to be programmed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/basic-terminal.png)\n\nWhile computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the\nsolution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

Please expect features to change and be added as development continues.*\n\n*This mod is for Fabric and Quilt. A Forge port is not planned at this time.*\n\n*All credit goes to EmilyPloszaj for the creation of EMI itself. This is just a plugin.*\n\n[![Join the Discord](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/zDbaYmUba2)\n\n#### Wiki\n\nFor guides on how to use the data-driven systems in EMI Loot, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/EMI_loot/wiki)\n\n#### Notable Features\n\n- Chest loot is sorted by percentage and includes drops added to the loot tables by mods.\n- If a chest has too many loot options to fit onto the screen, EMI Loot will condense the output into lists of items stacked by same-percentage. Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2024-06-09T17:13:29.759365Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":593741,"followers":227,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh","GUbMMJRo","91c49w5V","95aOKine","O3uMSDN0","6rFgo1Px","lwhMjJHL","DnmJpY7Z","QmFv0252"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"lwhMjJHL","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.6+1.20.1","version_number":"0.6.6+1.20.1","changelog":"* Update of condition icons, thanks to [gayasslily](https://modrinth.com/user/gayasslily)!\n* Fix thundering/not-thundering condition icons being missing\n* Added `canSend` check to packets\n* Fixed chest loot parsing not reading in chances added via `RandomChanceLootCondition`\n* Added ru_ru lang, thanks to [mpustovoi]https://github.com/mpustovoi)!\n* Fixed loot recipes not updating on datapack reload, thanks to [Abbie5](https://modrinth.com/user/Abbie)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-14T19:44:38.123888Z","downloads":60531,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ee215cef8c3a916d1ee084de1804c343c0167ae20123a03f60185c79fb6480db6c7a949769637eef834c31a0497afe8cffb002ddb739db9bec42bdc7be6ca417","sha1":"1ecb08d3a45f000e835e9214eb6bae282bd8fdb0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/lwhMjJHL/emi_loot-0.6.6%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":363534,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"fjpxz8db","username":"gayasslily","name":"Lily","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/fjpxz8db/8008d5d853889ec78ed06111577a56de684d0044.png","bio":"Creator of the modpack 'Lily's Vanilla OverQuilted'.\n\nI also make textures for stuff.","created":"2022-06-10T14:24:39.516887Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\create-fabric-0.5.1-f-build.1417+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"bc8e3afc219ecf9d475f4b56f421024f76fc20bce941a2c956ecca1e8905b39d946a124aca48cb391a0a60314d68fd5413c8c12d0ad1f605159b10611595878f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Xbc0uyRg","slug":"create-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"OzirJQCY","title":"Create Fabric","description":"Building Tools and Aesthetic Technology","body":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rR8W-f9YhYA\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Installation Requirements\n\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"156\" /></a></p>\n<p>This version of Create runs on <a href=\"https://fabricmc.net/\">Fabric</a> and <a href=\"https://quiltmc.org/\">Quilt</a> only.<br>You can find the version compatible with the Forge ecosystem <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/create\">here</a>.<br /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Our Patrons\n\nsintrinsic\n&#183;

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>.

This is required for Simply Skills to generate files. (Not needed for 1.20+ versions)**\n\n### **Features**\n\nSimply Skills provides a combat oriented skill tree for Fabric, complete with unique passive skills, specialisations, and signature abilities.\n\nDriven by a vision to enrich combat encounters within Minecraft, Simply Skills harnesses the power of the  [Spell Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-engine)  &  [Spell Power Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-power)  framework (created by Daedelus). By adopting this framework, players are empowered with distinctive skill sets that enable them to stand out among their peers and fully immerse themselves in the class fantasy they desire.\n\n#### **- Passive Skills -**\n\nUnlike the typical stat increase nodes on the tree, Passive Skills provide you with unique passive abilities that alter game mechanics in unique and meaningful ways.\n\n#### **- Specialisations -**\n\nSpecialisations can be unlocked by working your way through the base skill tree, until you reach a specialisation path. Once a specialisation path has been chosen, you will unlock an additional seperate skill tree that contains abilities and skills unique to your chosen specialisation. You may only have one specialisation unlocked at a time.\n\n#### **- Signature Abilities -**\n\nSignature Abilities, unlocked by advancing to a specialisation path, provide you with unique active abilities that can help to turn the tide of battle. These abilities can often be further enhanced and customised via passive nodes in the relevant specialisation skill tree. Due to their power, these abilities have an internal cooldown. (default keybind 'V')\n\n#### **- Respecialisation -**\n\nYour base skill tree can be reset by using a Malevolent Manuscript. This will refund all points spent in the tree.  \nIf you have a specialisation unlocked at the time of use, this will also erase all points spent within the specialisation tree. The points lost will be gone forever, so choose carefully.\n\n### **Roadmap**\nSubject to change\n\nQ4 2023: Ascendancy Tree\n- Additional late-game player progression\n\nQ1 2024: Additional Specialisations\n- Necromancer & Shaman\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWant to play with Simply Skills on a server with friends?

alt=\"CIT Resewn\" width=\"247\" height=\"247\"></center>\n<center>CIT Resewn is MCPatcher's CIT features re-written outside of optifine as a standalone mod for fabric</center>\n\n[<center><img

What does it do?\nMCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.\n\nCustom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.\n\nCIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!\n\nOn top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.\n\n### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?\nCIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.\n\nFirst, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called \"magic numbers\" instead of the new text ids will not work.\n\nSecond, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or \"broken\") paths.<br>\nThese are paths that contain \"Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes\" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)\n\nLastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:\n`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`\n\n### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?\nWhile CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.\n\nWith all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.\n\nThere were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.<br>\nMy official statement on compatibility with these mods is \"if it works it works\" unless I say otherwise.\n\n### What about Forge?\nForge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.\n\nDo not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.\n\n### 1.16/other versions?\nSee [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)\n\n<strike>If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.</strike><br>\nWell not anymore!

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-04-30T16:41:16.485547Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2917240,"followers":2198,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv","yvWntDTo","4vJjL6YG","95DrIgKD","7qhkYutC","9BeU4JMZ","DOvpgsS7","3DUWVimm","GCiXd1DU","lfYHLBCj","HuiMDCpB","KneJBt8W","dVfrkFFQ","rfh88j45","bwjbN1G7","kakr6cxQ","IzAfhCj5","rGuR7oQZ","fMRe5pGZ","652AHAwn","2hVd4znq","bCmmruN5","F1JjnEjo","mWAFiRcK","wa38cdv3","SfWhB6Bd","7bxh2EoP","aFlca15F","up2Xg2sy","jVIxXxpT","dzyn3ag2","mtJzKD3q","ORJKgPNp","rD5uCHNg","khwkB6ra","BitxFUOE","K0xj45PZ","9xVJZ8Xr","xvYCCPha","cqKSqPQH","gpqniM0d","QWCOTizL","ch6lB4Mh","ZBKoFavY","nAaR07o2","JN7NY56L","at9xKHYT","9PuZ3Kv1","sZcSLicd","S7FrTSoe","nYfJt8sH","OUq3XNDY","5SZ2FbHC","BzcsKF0w","av84l2vE","9BVLcBub","jkLvxFFA","g2i5i750","FTmtYNdf","84vLaMxp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/7a6acd528931a1a0d1b60fd0925b88227fb345cc.png"},"version":{"id":"jkLvxFFA","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 2.0.2","version_number":"2.0.2","changelog":"2.0.2\n- fixed the first person hand settings not getting reset correctly in 2.0.1\n- added the `is_swinging_right_arm` & `is_swinging_left_arm` boolean variables, \nused to distinguish right and left arm swinging in biped models, if no arm is swinging both should be false, if `swing_progress > 0` then one of these should be true.\n- added support for an optional `player_cape.jem` model file to be used for better animating the player cape\n`player_cape.jem` only contains a `cloak` part, positioned exactly as it is in the regular `player.jem`,\n  if this model is present it will render in a special way that will not apply the vanilla animations to the cape.\n  Allowing much easier custom animations\n  *(note this jem file can not be exported by the EMF config, but the `player.jem` exported model will work perfectly for it, as of v2.0.2)*\n\nThe only transforms EMF applies to `player_cape.jem` before rendering & custom animating is:\n- rotating the cape 180 degrees around the `y` axis.

It comes by default with\nbutton guides that appear across the whole game, helping you learn the controller layout. It also automatically detects\nyour controller's make and model, displaying relevant Minecraft-style button textures for a more intuitive experience.\nControlify \"just works\" out of the box, no need to spend tens of minutes getting your controller feeling like any other\ngame, thanks to the sane defaults I have created.\n\n### Feature-rich\n\nControlify strives to support all the added features that may come with your controller.\n\n- It supports gyroscopes natively, allowing for precise movements.\n- It comes with vibration/rumble support, making your gameplay more immersive (this is even missing on Bedrock Edition!)\n- Soon, HD haptics support for DualSense controllers, something never seen outside a Playstation game.\n- Support for non-standard joysticks such as flight sticks, given a small amount of setup.\n\n### Compatibility focus\n\nI, the developer have actively collaborated with fellow mod creators of performance mods like Sodium and Iris to\nensure seamless controller functionality throughout these custom GUIs. This will mean a more friction-free environment\nthat lets you focus on playing the game, instead of battling through the menus.\n\n## Q&A\n\n### Does it support Steam Deck?\n\n**Yes!** Controlify has been tested and is fully working on the Steam Deck, and works great. \nHowever, due to limitations with SteamOS, only Steam games can currently interface with the gyroscope and the\nback buttons directly, though [this is set to change in the coming months](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/9148)!\nFor now, you can use Steam Input to convert the gyro into a mouse input, and map the back buttons to other, more common\nbuttons.\n\n### Does it support my controller?\n\nControlify supports most controllers out of the box, any generic gamepad-like controller is bound to work fine, at\nleast in a basic state, giving inputs. Though, more strange and uncommon controllers such as handhelds like the ROG \nAlly may be missing features such as gyroscope.\n\nIf you are having trouble getting your controller working correctly, you can \n[join my discord server](https://short.isxander.dev/discord) or consult \n[the wiki](https://docs.isxander.dev/controlify/users/controller-compatibility-guide) for assistance.\n\n## Features\n\n### Controller vibration\n\nControlify supports controller vibration, which has not been seen before for PC versions of Minecraft,\nincluding Bedrock Windows 10 Edition. Configure the intensity of each vibration source, with\ncomplex vibration patterns for lots of aspects of the game (e.g. when you take damage).\n\n![picture of vibration config](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8a7809d07d9e1d9e3002007d7e5e13b73ce8fb5b.png)\n\n### Radial menu\n\n![radial menu showcase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/e56d9be363b2b31440e16018cc01f197848b7ac6.webp)\n\nTo save up some buttons on your controller, dedicate some less-used actions to the radial menu.\nIt is fully customizable through the settings and intuitive to use. Any modded keybind is\ncompatible with this menu.\n\n### Built-in gyro support\n\nControlify has built-in support for controller gyroscopes, allowing you to make fine movements in-game\nwith your controller. This can be combined with [flick stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bw5xct/flick_stick_is_a_new_way_to_control_3d_games_with/) to be able to use a controller without\nthe compromise.\n\n### Container cursor\n\nJust like in bedrock edition, you can move a cursor across your inventory, and interact\nwith it in a controller-friendly way. With dedicated buttons for quick move, dropping etc. Controlify also comes with cursor snapping, so you don't need to be so precise with cursor movements.\n\n![container cursor screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/249a2cbaea9b374b33fe67717380e732693dd37a.png)\n\n### Controller identification\n\nControlify has the ability to identify the make and model of your controller automatically,\nand displays relevant button textures for your controller. This is also extendable by resource packs, changing up the button textures in a different style and adding some of your own, more niche controller identifiers.\n\n![demonstration of data-driven identification](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/ec1408d51787b87525b9fb0f2e56b54c5910d384.png)\n\n### Joystick support\n\nYou can connect any joystick to the mod and map it with your own names and textures, with an unlimited amount of inputs per controller.\n\n### Button guide\n\nThere is a simple overlay in-game that displays the buttons you can press\nbased on your player's state and look direction. This is useful for new players, who\nhave not yet memorised the controls.\n\n![image of in-game button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/57c41cee14680c74faf947c5cff355c0af4c35b3.png)\n\nAlso, some GUIs display controller buttons on elements that have a controller shortcut, to easily navigate with a controller like you should be able to.\n\n![image of in-screen button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/511e4182137bb27bbdf95539c8265b9af2038761.webp)\n\n### Containerised Controllers\n\nThis mod is built around the fact that each controller is completely separate, with it's own configuration, bindings etc.\nThis means it will be trivial to add support for split-screen play in the future.\n\n### Built for mod compatibility\n\nGUI operation has been abstracted into a simple API, which allows other mods to easily add support for their own GUIs,\nwithout convoluted support throughout the whole mod's codebase, making it difficult for third parties to integrate.\n\n![demonstration of dabr compat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8ee5ec167bc5f8be96da725b10707094559138cb.gif)\n\n*Video recorded using do-a-barrel-roll with a Thrustmaster HOTAS flightstick*\n\n### Automatic controller deadzone calibration\n\nThe deadzone values of your controller are automatically calibrated, \nmeaning you don't have to worry about it.\n\n![image of calibration screen](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/f5f8e2a0a05e61adb95dd919760b424165ca5d14.png)\n\n## What is to come?\n\nA few features in various points in the horizon are:\n\n- Explicit Steam Deck support, with the ability to interface with its gyroscope and be able to handle its extra buttons on the back of the device.\n- A better way to change controller bindings, possibly a custom graphical GUI to pick what buttons do what actions, not the other way around.\n- Split-screen support of some degree.\n\n## Backports?\n\nThis mod is only and will only be available for **1.19.4** and above, this is because in 1.19.4, Mojang\nintroduced arrow key navigation which was easily ported to controller, below 1.19.4, this is not possible.\n","published":"2023-02-05T13:04:45.141986Z","updated":"2024-05-26T23:06:22.264754Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1143963,"followers":390,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w14potato","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["L5wBKwLP","O4X3TycI","XvbPbLuc","ViaGpYcG","mvoRZ4lr","TSgUsWWO","ZshsEOjG","OVsSpUi5","4eYmOLUb","jvUMhWpD","3L7GCFAd","v9yBe6Ye","hA4E3OIW","pKaQjz0y","60bCNc7N","FLIWpoEL","qHzBhRrd","h5ZThJ8W","FXJNOVCT","GJuiYIvz","uPbwSdJT","aT4dMJAD","xncNJgTg","y7xMOOMU","Oquy1mdB","L2JeMo5i","MSWp1Dsg","CzlyUU6C","QPb34aQS","5MMK5oJQ","E0IjfW25","1sbnpZZs","ATnQknqh","2oEDJIbx","6GKVGWLK","10SuJx9U","MZzohk5u","JbIeEVC9","Cs3ZJcvV","klbkkBCv","im0SBR8Y","Buc2lLKA","zYDV0AOF","C8BV2Qy4","Zd1jZT0f","MGnpqXdx","FeADDFg7","QpBHNrxY","fyZT7z6k","RJ59Pb7W","Zkei91rh","UrYvrQox","ba3azLbW","Q5nQC6JX","naETXOxy","cif1Amua","mpnMZdQU","FvddUeFM","cgUUVpN5","zPpBE48u","BtV20YRT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/4f8cdb3933f9efa0c5dfd5574d3ad6b101c7f3ef.png"},"version":{"id":"BtV20YRT","project_id":"DOUdJVEm","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Controlify 2.0.0-beta.10 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"2.0.0-beta.10+1.20.1","changelog":"# Controlify 2.0.0-beta.10\n\nThis version has the following builds -

island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1880723,"followers":1801,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"mjuG4AYd","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.4 Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.26","version_number":"1.20-2.26-fabric","changelog":"- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-02T16:59:36.217330Z","downloads":223452,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6a6b977e671b1ab625e740fc70fb5300c21bb841","sha512":"d0faf200dda358efddad2d2809f646023f4dd06254572369e07f3bf33cb6941f0fcdb02db4675b30b4f3bd542cbf6196e135680ba91a2b74c2b071f34978e2d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","primary":true,"size":77943,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"92e908a8ac714509904a6b484a24c68a43569a28a4a2800d9ea1144c8de9476363707e40c7eb3739712a0c94312b244f014f8114ca83b668b55a4b7164f56abf","sha1":"42f757f20c9437f93aa9aa912519231db91e961c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65765,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar"},"mods\\explosive-enhancement-1.2.2-1.20.x.jar":{"sha512":"f946a5ba189a5d0fdeb64a1d3f9b7cbc8daeaa4ab94fc4b07d0904e3c9883233a1fae9e3e7040cf2e9d9262be06241614e3933b9ca720619164b95f6af15ae22","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OSQ8mw2r","slug":"explosive-enhancement","project_type":"mod","team":"RCkqJVDY","title":"Explosive Enhancement","description":"Makes the explosion animation look cooler.","body":"# Explosive Enhancement\n\n### Enhancing explosions since 2023.\n\nExplosive Enhancement is a simple mod that makes explosions look better.

Right-clicking on a rift causes you to enter it, without having to use a door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Dungeons</span></h2>\n<p>Dungeons are special kinds of pocket dimensions filled with treasures, puzzles, traps, and dimensional doors leading to deeper dungeons. Although it might be tempting to break walls and bypass a puzzle, be careful of monoliths that may be waiting right outside those walls to teleport you to limbo!</p>\n<p>A dungeon can either be entered using a gateway, a rare structure that can be found throughout the world, or by using a gold dimensional door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Fabric of reality</span></h2>\n<p>Fabric is the material out of which dungeons are made. It comes in several variations:</p>\n<p><strong>Fabric of Reality:</strong> Completely black block that absorbs all light. It can be replaced by right clicking with a block, or mined using a silk touch pickaxe. Be careful, this looks exactly like the void in dungeons!</p>\n<p><strong>Altered Fabric:</strong> Fabric of reality that has been altered to become white, or any other color. White altered fabric is found in personal pocket dimensions. Other colors can be crafted by combining Fabric of Reality with a dye.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancient Fabric:</strong>&nbsp;Black bedrock-like fabric that surrounds some pocket dungeons</p>\n<p><strong>Altered Ancient Fabric:</strong> Colored variations of Eternal Fabric. It is uncraftable since eternal fabric is unobtainable, but the white one is found in personal pockets.</p>\n<p><strong>Eternal Fluid:</strong> Found deep in Limbo, providing a way for players stuck in Limbo to escape</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Limbo</span></h2>\n<p>A dark, foggy, and mysterious dimension filled with monoliths, where players who died or tried to cheat in a dungeon end up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 36px;\">F.A.Q.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Q: Why am I set on fire when leaving a Pocket Dimension?&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(Fixed in 1.17+ versions)</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">: It's a Vanilla bug.

you return to the Title Screen early while your world is still saving in the background!","body":"## FastQuit\n\n### About this mod\n\nThis mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.\n\nDon't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!\n\nThe world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.\nThis is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.\n\nIn its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.\nIf you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.\n\n**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**\n\n### Join the Discord!\n\nIf you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!\n\n### Configure\n\nTo configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.\n\nThere is currently three options to configure:\n\n**Show Toasts**:\n\nDetermines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.\n\n**Background Thread Priority**:\n\nSets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.\nThis is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.\nValue has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.\n\n**Render \"Saving world\" Screen**:\n\nWhen playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.\nBy enabling this setting the \"Saving world\" screen will be rendered.\n\n**Show Saving Time**\n\nDetermines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.\nValue has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

This mod adds a hand full of peripherals that allow futher access to Creates features.\n\n## Content\n> 👉 _**Create** now actually has native support for **CC: Tweaked** too! But why stop there?_\n\n- **Two essential blocks of this mod are the `Source Block` and `Target Block`.**\nThey simulate a source or target, making it possible to comunicate within every other source/target that **Create** provides.\n\n- Another block that can come in very handy is the `RedRouter Block`.\nIt can send or receive redstone signals without having to worry about wireless channels or by using multible Computers, using the Redstone API.\n\n- This mod also adds some smaller, fun things like the `Scroller Pane` or `Animatronic`. The Scroller Pane lets you select a number and send it to a Computer using **Creates** interface, while the Animatronic is a puppet you can [control and animate as you like!](https://youtu.be/MI_tHMHrAY0)\n\n### Psst, hey! Why don't you check out the gallery as well?\n\n## Tutorials\n_But how do I use the peripherals?_ Good question! We are constantly updating **our [wiki section](https://cccbridge.tweaked-programs.cc/)**, in order to make it easy for you developers to keep up with all the changes! **We now switched to our own domain for this!**\n\n> 👉 _Just like **CC: Tweaked**, we try to keep backwards compatibility as much as possible!

Cards into Create Fabric from [Create: Misc & Things](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-misc-and-things).\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can view the recipes in REI/JEI too.\n\n### Card Inscriber\n![Card Inscriber Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/002beab49da8424db7901f435e59da1ce353708a.png)\n\n![Card Inscriber GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/59995dd6a6f1fe736988d7440271859bc0c0879f.png)\n\nUse this block to inscribe your empty cards and tickets.\nIt additionally takes in 1 Ink Sac and 1 Name Tag. Press the button to inscribe the card. The Name Tag will not get consumed.\n\nYou can optionally give the Name Tag a custom name using an Anvil to give your Cards different purposes.\n\n#### Inscribing Tickets\n\nInserting a Empty Ticket into the Card Inscriber causes a new field to show up.\n\n![Ticket in Card Inscriber](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/bd26b3cb7ad5e4ca7906a0be86b5179e6f902c3f.png)\n\nUse the scroll wheel on this field to change the amount of uses this ticket should have.\n\n### Card Reader\n![Card Reader Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6b915cc714611b2583352eb92a40817507bcae0d.png)\n\nThis block emits a redstone signal when it reads a valid card.\n\nOnce placed, use a Wrench on it.\n\n![Card Reader GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/25af49e28a03945d72dd6aa57ab8a4d83b5bd330.png)\n\nOnly the owner can open this menu. Place a Card or Ticket into the first slot and press the plus button to add it to this reader. The amount of cards and tickets registered are shown next to this button. Next to that is a trash button to remove all cards and tickets from the reader.\nBelow is an option to change the length of the redstone pulse emitted. Use the scroll wheel to change the values. \"Ticks\" can be changed to \"Seconds\".\n\nThe owner and the custom name are stored, so cards with the same name made by the same person are considered the same.\n\n### Empty Card\n![Empty Card Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/83fdc59dc5f8ee8475a69eabcbf7c3a45195ddca.png)\n\nUse this in a Card Inscriber.\n\n### Empty Ticket\n![Empty Ticket](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6dd91703cec40ae39cebd07ce4a95a2e36052af7.png)\n![Used Ticket](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/038f3a73079f9cedf33a513c047f4efb353594a4.png)\n\nSingle-use card. Use this in a Card Inscriber too.\n\n## Port to Forge or MC Version x?\n\nNo. As for updating to new MC Versions, yes, soon.\n\n## Can I use this mod in modpacks?\n\nYep.

☕️ Support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/daedelus \"\"), if you like my project\n\n# 🔮️ Features\n\nThis library introduces new Entity Attributes for powering magical abilities, for the following magic types (schools):\n\n- 🔮 Arcane\n- 🔥 Fire\n- ❄️ Frost\n- 💚 Healing\n- ⚡️ Lightning\n- 👻 Soul\n\n(Note: the design intent is to stay native to Minecraft, but establish Warcraft like magic schools. So no classic 4 element schools are implemented, besides fire.)\n\nThe library offers an API to query spell damage of an entity (based on its attributes, status effects, enchantments), and provides critical strike chance and multiplier.

In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6005885,"followers":5201,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":1719853,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\Ping-Wheel-1.8.0-fabric-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"cc0766467b656f2d590c9ed8f21f00e85b47c614d769704f19ef260fd7d726ba8825f141b80206e347ccfc3f264f5cb146bf8ddd92df5d81497de777b300a39c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"QQXAdCzh","slug":"ping-wheel","project_type":"mod","team":"g3BKublM","title":"Ping Wheel","description":"Allows players to temporarily mark locations and entities","body":"## About\n\nModern co-op games often allow players to communicate via \"pings\" to mark in-game locations.  \nThis simple mod provides such pinging mechanism for the fabric and forge mod loaders.\n\nDefault keybind is \"Mouse5\" aka \"Forward\" to ping.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-06-05T23:03:18.395993Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":533723,"followers":533,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W","NoFBkXQe","9Vscdpuz","CEmkqbKV","qpG9cRjY","fZYI0nmw","mfB8KDaB","L3u3Zbmr","Fx9uV7AL","eQcAHHqJ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qpG9cRjY","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":true,"name":"AE2

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Gap Fix","description":"Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models","body":"Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2024-03-21T17:21:40.224008Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2164384,"followers":1218,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3","BEeRgTMS","kST7zzvZ","GkLb4bRl","og4A1nN8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"GkLb4bRl","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.15","version_number":"1.15","changelog":"changed

Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/support_discord-~yes~-375fe5)](https://discord.gg/XJWVax7mbg)\n\n_More immersion!_\n\n## What is this?\n\nWith the normal Create behavior, the player's camera stays in the same direction when the train turns, giving the appearance that the player themselves are turning. This mod turns the player's camera with the train they're riding to provide more immersion. This mod also applies \"lean\" and \"roll\" to the player when the train is on a slope.\n\nThe mod should also work while standing on the train, though this functionality is a bit experimental at the moment (and horribly unsafe). If you have any issues (with the mod), [remember to report them!](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues)\n\n**Notice:** This mod may cause motion sickness. Just like real trains, but blockier.\n\nThis is a client-side only mod. It does nothing on the server and will probably crash if you try to use it on one anyways, so don't do that!!\n","published":"2024-02-17T07:59:27.376346Z","updated":"2024-06-10T06:25:58.197173Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7697,"followers":34,"categories":["cursed","transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kzCQgyS7","bQ2P1OBV","IkpHTtIB","qj8jwhaN","1fzfEucG","V4NAx8Z7","J1dQrXvN","Q8PJSazk","RaYyuwbK","L3rq7yhs","8Q9phh59","ZvRwoMOl","lKTszflA","VNKwZvpB","QYPZSNqc","5g8FWCet","x7i7t4hR","O86ekHSB","J9IC8WFh","SMqfDcT5","4ormSYD9","5kScXSj3","32RSW4DC","tuGWdBsA","QfNRyuzn","1TD5UmuG","FgeSu16D","FWNdp3DA","xR2RHtwX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MAuPqvf1/cd82108355df96c7925dcba208d3b09962e43afb.png"},"version":{"id":"SMqfDcT5","project_id":"MAuPqvf1","author_id":"ytkMuPEv","featured":false,"name":"Create:

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2024-05-06T17:10:49.440737Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1222898,"followers":850,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF","iKVUNCME","i3FZxFQO","h0hKeaRD","85t1ZpLC","vl2NraaO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"XGW2fviP","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":false,"name":"1.10.53 (Fabric 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-fabric","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

All leaves are gone after about one second (configurable). That's it, nothing special about it so far!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Why another leaf decay mod? Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;
